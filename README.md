## Summary

This is an emulator to play games based on the virtual 8 chip.

## Requirements

You only have to install .NET Framework 4.5

## How to use

I don't provide any installer or executable at this moment. 
This means that you've to compile the emulator by yourself.

Just open the project using Visual Studio, restore the required Nuget packages, hit the start button and have fun.

## Attention

This emulator is just a proof of concept. So the emulator isn't probably able to run all available game without any bugs or crashes.

Also be aware of the code quality. As I mention, it's just a POC. But hopefully someone can learn from this and can maybe get started into emulator programming easier.
